To train a model, you need
	-engine.py	#Responsible for training a single epoch
	-transforms.py	#Manages images transformations
	-utils.py	#Used for its collate function
	-coco_eval.py	#Used for evaluating trained model after each epoch
	-coco_utils.py	#Used for converting annoation datasets to COCO format as it is used in PyTorch.

To use model:
	-statistics_visualisation.py
	-score_analysis.py
